## 1. Executive Summary & Abstract

Traditional online quiz applications operate primarily in a solitary, asynchronous format where users individually answer questions and compare static scores on a delayed leaderboard. **Quiz Battle** transforms online assessment into an immersive, synchronous, real-time multiplayer gaming experience inspired by broadcast quiz bowls and circular esports arenas.

The platform introduces a **Circular Turn-Based Multiplayer Engine** rendered on a circular gaming table where participants occupy designated visual seats around a central question dais. Operating over low-latency WebSockets (Socket.IO) backed by a persistent MongoDB Atlas cloud database, the system implements turn-based question rotation with sophisticated rules:
- **Rule A (Correct Answer):** Awards +2 marks, concludes the current question, and advances to the next question for the next participant in circular order.
- **Rule B (Incorrect Answer):** Deducts -1 mark, ends the current question, and assigns a new question to the next participant.
- **Rule C (The Pass Rule):** Awards 0 marks (no penalty), **retains the exact same question**, and passes the turn to the adjacent competitor. The question circulates until answered correctly or exhausted by all participants.
- **Rule D (Universal Pass):** If every player passes, the question is retired, and a fresh question is issued to the original starting player.
- **Author Isolation:** The quiz creator acts strictly as the **Game Controller / Host**, possessing administrative controls (Start, Pause, Resume, End Game) without participating as a competitor or polluting the player leaderboard.

## 2. Project Objectives

1. **Synchronous Real-Time Multiplayer Gameplay:** Transition beyond static single-player forms into an interactive live arena utilizing bidirectional WebSocket events.
2. **Circular Turn-Based Rotation:** Architect an automated turn engine featuring individual 25-second countdown timers, active turn indicators, and circular player rotation.
3. **Question Retention & Passing Mechanics:** Implement strategic passing rules where questions circulate among contenders without penalty, increasing competitiveness.
4. **Author & Player Role Separation:** Enforce architectural separation where the quiz host moderates the session (monitoring live scores and turn progress) without receiving answering rights or leaderboard scores.
5. **Real-Time Cloud Persistence:** Eliminate static/mock datasets by integrating MongoDB Atlas for dynamic CRUD operations on users, quizzes, attempts, and real-time leaderboards.
6. **Responsive Gaming UI/UX:** Deliver a neon purple and deep navy cyber-gaming interface featuring smooth animations, avatar highlights, sound effects, celebratory confetti, and mobile responsiveness.

## 3. Technology Stack

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The platform is built entirely on the modern JavaScript/TypeScript full-stack ecosystem. Python, Django, and local SQLite have been eliminated in favor of high-performance Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and cloud MongoDB Atlas.

## 6. Core Features & Circular Turn-Based Game Engine

### 6.1 Waiting Lobby & Duration Selection
- Upon quiz creation, the creator specifies a **Lobby Start Countdown** (5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes) and a **Player Turn Limit** (Default: 25 seconds).
- A 5-character alphanumeric Room Code (e.g., `QZ782`) is generated.
- A scrollable participant panel displays real-time joins.
- The **Author** is visually branded with an amber Author Badge and isolated from the participant roster.
- When the lobby timer expires, the author is prompted to begin, or the author may initiate early via **Start Game Now**.

### 6.2 Circular Multiplayer Gaming Table
- **Circular Table Canvas:** A circular neon-purple gaming table arranged with dynamic polar coordinates:
  $$\theta_i = \left(\frac{2\pi}{N}\right) \cdot i - \frac{\pi}{2}$$
- **Active Contender Spotlight:** The current player's avatar pulses with golden rings, glowing border indicators, and a live synchronized countdown bar.
- **Center Question Dais:** The active question and 4 multiple-choice options are mounted in the table center. Non-active players observe options in disabled mode with an *"Active Turn: [PlayerName]"* overlay.

### 6.3 Exact Game Rules Matrix

| Rule | Action | Score Impact | Question Disposition | Turn Transition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rule A: Correct Answer** | Contender selects correct option | **+2 Marks** | Question Concludes | Moves to $(i+1) \pmod N$ with a **new** question. |
| **Rule B: Incorrect Answer** | Contender selects wrong option | **-1 Mark** | Question Concludes | Moves to $(i+1) \pmod N$ with a **new** question. |
| **Rule C: Pass Action** | Contender clicks **Pass** | **0 Marks** (No Penalty) | **Retains Same Question** | Moves to $(i+1) \pmod N$ with the **same** question. |
| **Rule D: Universal Pass** | All participants pass on question | **0 Marks** | Question Retired | Moves to original starter with a **new** question. |
| **Rule E: Timeout** | 25s timer reaches 0:00 | **0 Marks** | Treated as Rule C Pass | Advances turn to next player with same question. |
| **Rule F: Author Controls** | Host clicks Pause / Resume / End | N/A | State freezes / persists | Author controls game lifecycle without playing. |

    actor Author as Quiz Author (Host)
    actor Player as Contender (Player)
    participant Socket as Socket.IO Server
    participant DB as MongoDB Atlas

    Player->>Socket: join_room { roomCode, user }
    Socket->>Author: game_state_update (Roster Updated)
    Author->>Socket: start_game { roomCode, authorId }
    Socket->>Player: game_state_update (Status: in_progress, Question 1)
    
    Note over Player,Socket: Active player gets 25s turn
    alt Correct Answer (+2 pts)

        Socket->>DB: Record score +2
        Socket->>All: game_state_update (Q1 ended, Q2 to next player)
    else Pass Turn (0 pts)
        Player->>Socket: pass_turn { roomCode, userId }
        Socket->>All: game_state_update (SAME Q1 rotated to adjacent player)
    end

    Author->>Socket: end_game { roomCode, authorId }
    Socket->>DB: Bulk write attempts & update leaderboards
    Socket->>All: game_state_update (Final Rankings & Podium)
```

## 9. Security & Anti-Cheat Architecture

1. **Hidden Answer Keys:** In multiplayer and single-player modes, the server strictly filters out `correct_option` before dispatching questions to the client. Correctness is evaluated strictly server-side.
2. **Turn Authentication:** The Socket.IO server validates that incoming answer or pass events originate exclusively from the current turn holder's `user_id`. Off-turn events are rejected.
3. **Host Privilege Isolation:** Control events (`start_game`, `pause_game`, `resume_game`, `end_game`) verify that `socket.authorId === room.authorId` before processing.
4. **Cryptographic Protection:** Passwords are never stored in plaintext; SHA-256 cryptographic salts ensure credential defense.
5. **Environment Isolation:** Cloud credentials and database URIs are isolated inside `.env` configurations excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
